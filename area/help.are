.                    Original game idea, concept, and design:

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@@freja.diku.dk)

-1 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
Midgaard's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins are worth
100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as 
opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems
from the Midgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.
10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces for
the highest quality stones.
~
0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~
-1 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).

Syntax: prompt <%*>
 
PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.

~
-1 DEATH~
> When your character dies, your spirit is reincarnated back to the altar
of the temple in your hometown.  Your corpse is left behind in the room
that you were killed in, along with all of your equipment.
 
> After you die, you become a 'ghost' for the next few game hours, during which
time nothing will attack you.  This allows you to retrieve your equipment when
you are killed by an aggressive mobile.
 
> Death does not affect groups or those following you.
 
> You lose roughly 2/3's of the experience you had earned towards your next
level, and ever third death you lose one point of constitution.  Constitution
lost due to dying is retrainable.
 
> Pc corpses decay eventually, after roughly 30 minutes of real time.
~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your race and class.
You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
    A group which consist of two player will reduce your experience points 
25 % of real exp which got if alone.
    A group which consist of three player will reduce your experience points
50 % of real exp which got if alone. 
~
0 COLOR COLOUR ANSI~
Syntax: toggle color             Toggles color mode on/off

You may also talk in color; the format is like this: the 'escape character'
to specify a color is the left handed brace '{{', following that you should
use one of the following numbers,

         {x{{x     reset, returns to default

         {r{{r     red     {m{{m     magenta
         {g{{g     green   {c{{c     cyan
         {y{{y     yellow  {w{{w     white
         {b{{b     blue    {D{{D     grey{x

For brighter colors, use the shifted letters: {RR{GG{YY{BB{MM{CC{WW{x
When using color, it looks better if you finish the line with whatever
color it would normally be in, such as a gossip, the color is magenta, so:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
        looks better than:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

Other {{? sequences are:
         {{*     beep    {{\     new line
         {{z     reset to previous color

Color is courtesy of Lope from Loping Through The MUD.

the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.

New pets are planned for a shop in New Thalos.
~
0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  

Area resetting happens roughly every 106 sec. if no one is in the area;
less often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on
the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

-2 NAME~
NAME POLICY:
In order to create a role-playing and adventure atmosphere throughout the
realms of Muddy, you must choose a name accordingly explained below:
 
ACCEPTABLE:
1)  Proper names, medieval or modern. i.e  (Takasi, Mitra)
2)  Created names with a medieval or fictional sound.  (Priatros, Sansoles)
 
UNACCEPTABLE:                                                        
1)  Vulgar or sexually suggestive names.  (No examples needed)
2)  Nouns which are names of animals.  (Horse, Doll)          
3)  Strings of random characters.  (Asdfg, Qwdldkf)                
4)  Titles which imply rank or privelege.   (Lord, Sir,...)
5)  Scientific phrases, words. (Proof, Logic, Electrics...)
6)  Object names. (Necklace, Staff, Sword etc)              
7)  Compound names. (FarmerJoe, Maryjane etc.)
 
Anyway, immortals may ask you to choose another name if they consider your name inappropriate.

If your name fits above restrictions, type Y. Otherwise choose another name.
Last decision depends upon Immortals of Realms of Muddy. Do you accept?
~
0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~
0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~
0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.

~
0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~
0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

If you are affected by pass door spell then you can flee passing the 
closed doors.

You cannot flee to inside of the clans when you are fighting with the 
clan guardians.
 
If you are Samurai, after level 10 you can NOT FLEE,so be careful.(You may 
flee if victim's level is much higher than your level (level difference is
6). But you won't wimp out.)

perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~
0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~
0 TELL REPLY SAY GTELL ;~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work

is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your

and camouflage making you visible again.
~
0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object. The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving. Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
You do not need to save. Every save operation requested by the players 
causes lag. The Muddy' auto saver does not cause even a tiny lag.

Some objects, such as keys and some maps, may not be saved. Those very 
powerful items of very limited number, are not saved if you are below 
level 10.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to gods for miraculous transportation from where you are

below level 10, by only their praying. You must be calm enough to 
concenterate and pray to the gods, so you are not able to pray not 
only in the fights, but also sometime after a fight. Those who are over 
level 10 must find a way to cast the spell to recall.

curse may not recall at all.

~
0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute.
You receive one session per five levels.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
 
~
100 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~
100 TRUST~

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
92 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
        ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
        ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~
99 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
        shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used

Shutdown prevents the normal 'startup' script from restarting server after
reboot.
~
96 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to Muddy. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 91), except for link-dead players
who are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation,
typically used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should
be avoided,and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~
99 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~
97 DISCONNECT~

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~
97 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~
93 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 97 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~
96 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~
96 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~
98 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~
95 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string

	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~
96 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~
96 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~
97 SLAY~

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~
95 TRANSFER TELEPORT~

	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~
94 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~
94 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~
92 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~
92 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 100 characters are totally 
invisible.
~
92 INCOGNITO~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.
~
92 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~
96 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~
93 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~
93 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~
95 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~
92 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>

'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)

protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~
95 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

~
-1 GNOME~
Rock Gnomes are the most common race of the gnomish race.  Ever cheerful,
these dimunitive beings are well known for their great wisdom.  The most
distinctive feature of a Rock Gnome are their enormous noses.  The size of a
Rock Gnome's nose is a matter of some status among their fellows, and one is
proud to boast having the largest proboscis.  Rock Gnomes tend to care
little for the world of politics, and will remain neutral in most matters. 
Though they can not see as well in the dark as their cousins, the
Svirfneblin, they are also gifted with innate infravision.  
 
~
-1 'STORM GIANT' STORMGIANTS~
Storm giants are easily the largest of the giants, growing from 12-20
feet in height.  Due to their size, storm giants are gifted with
extraordinary strength and stamina, receiving fast healing, enhanced damage,
and bash for free.  Their size, however, makes them rather clumsy.  They are
particularly skilled in the use of swords, and will find that they are
capable of wielding any two-handed weapon in one hand with ease.  The slow
minds make them susceptable to mental attacks, and they do not tolerate
extremes of heat or cold well.  Storm giants are naturally resistant to
lightning though, and like cloud giants, they are able to fly continously. 
As any of the other giant races, they will find themselves best suited to
train as a warrior, a profession in which they excel.  Storm giants are well
known for their dedication to the preservation of the law and their loathing
for evil.  
~
-1 'FIRE GIANT' FIREGIANTS~
Fire giants are one of the largest races of giant, ranging in size from
10-16 feet in height.  Due to their size, they are gifted with extraordinary
strength and stamina, receiving fast healing, enhanced damage, and bash for
free.  They are particularly skilled in the use of swords, and will find
that they are able to wield any two-handed weapon in one hand easily.  Their
size does affect them negatively, making them rather clumsy, also causing
them to take additional damage from lightning.  Their slow minds make them
vulnerable to all forms of mental attack, but they are naturally resistant
to heat and take little damage from fire attacks.  Fire giants are not
accustomed to extreme temperatures of cold and will find that they take more
damage from cold attacks.  Like any other race of giant, they will find
themselves best suited to train as a warrior, a profession in which they
excel.  Fire giants are notoriously evil and have great difficulty in
obeying the law.  
~
-1 'CLOUD GIANT' 'CLOUD GIANTS' CLOUDGIANTS~
Cloud giants are the smallest race of giants, ranging in size from 9-14
feet in height.  Due to their size as giants, they are gifted with
extraordinary strength and stamina, receiving fast healing, enhanced damage,
and bash for free.  They are particularly skilled in the use of swords, and
will find that they are capable of wielding any two-handed weapon in one
hand with ease.  Their size does affect them negatively, however, making
them rather clumsy, and causing them to take additional damage from
lightning attacks.  Their slow minds make them susceptable to mental
attacks.  However their ethereal bodies give them resistance to weapons, and
cause them to continuously float above the ground.  Like any other race of
giant, they will find themselves best suited to train as a warrior, a
profession in which they excel.  Cloud giants are a neutral race, desiring a
balance of good and evil in the world.  
~
-1 'FROST GIANT' FROSTGIANTS~
Frost giants are only slightly smaller than fire giants in size, ranging
from 9-15 feet in height.  Due to their size, they are gifted with
extraordinary strength and stamina, receiving fast healing, enhanced damage,
and bash.  They are particularly skilled in the use of swords, and will find
that they are able to wield a two-handed weapon easily in one hand.  Also
due to their large size, they take extra damage from lightning, and are
rather clumsy.  Their slow minds make them vulnerable to all forms of mental
attack, but they are naturally resistant to the cold and take little damage
from cold attacks.  Frost giants, however, can not tolerate extreme
temperatures of heat and take extra damage from fire attacks.  Frost giants,
like any other giant race, will find themselves best suited to train as a
warrior.  Frost giants are notoriously evil and have great difficulty in
obeying the law.  
~
-1 GIANT GIANTS~
Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They
are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  
They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy
than the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are
ill-suited for any other profession. Giants, due to their size and 
stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for free. 

~
-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~
Humans are the most common of races, making up the majority of the
population in the realms.  Though they have no unusual race related
abilities or strengths, they have no known weaknesses.  Humans find that
they are able to choose and excel in any profession with equal ease.  
 
~
-1 DWARF DWARVES~
Dwarves are stocky, powerful demi-humans who are known for their short
tempers, great strength and legendary stamina.  Dwarves are fairly
intelligent and wise, and their stubby arms, though powerful, greatly lack
dexterity.  Years spent living in the rough wilderness and mountains has
given them a natural resistance to both poison and disease, combined with
inherent infravision.  They hate the sight of water, though, and will not
take a bath until their companions begin to complain to them of their odor. 
This natural hatred for water has kept them from learning to swim, and thus
they drown very easily.  
 
~
-1 ELF ELVES~
Elves are slightly taller than most humans, but have a much lighter
build.  They lack the strength and stamina of many other races, but are far
more agile in body and mind.  Due to their magic nature, elves resist charm
spells most effectively, but are burned by the cold touch of iron, and shun
its use in their careers.  Elves are notoriously hard to spot and their
light footfalls difficult to hear.  They see well in the night due to their
infravision and feel at home in a dark forest.  Elves believe strongly in
upholding the law, and will not be seen breaking it.  
 
~
-1 'HALF-ELF' HALFELF HALFELVES~
Half-elves have both human and elven blood flowing through their veins. 
They resemble thin, medium height humans with distinctly pointed elven ears,
and have similiar strengths.  Half-elves have the dexterity and intelligence
of an elf, but are more frail than humans.  They have inherited a natural
resistance to charm and infravision from their elven side, but have lost the
ability to move silently like their fullblooded cousins.  Burned by its
touch, half-elves shun the use of iron equipment.  
 
~
-1 SVIRFNEBLIN DEEP-GNOME~
Svirfneblin, also known as Deep Gnomes, spend most of their lives
underground mining ore from the earth.  Years spent in harsh and unfavorable
conditions deep underground have given them a natural resistance to poison
and disease, along with natural infravision.  Svirfneblin also have a
natural resistance to magic which stands them in good stead while
experimenting with new spellcasting techniques as they are apt to do.  All
gnomes are small, averaging 4-5 feet in height.  Their diminutive size puts
them at big disadvantage when facing larger opponents and they find that
they are easily bashed, taking great damage from those attacks.  Svirfneblin
care nothing for society, and politics bore them, thus they remain neutral
in all matters.  
 
~
-1 FELAR FELARS~
Felar are a catlike race of humanoids.  Much larger than the average
human, a felar will grow 6-8 feet in height.  Along with their size, they
have great strength and very quick reflexes.  Being the magical creatures
that they are, Felar are resistant to lightning attacks, and have natural
infravision.  They are covered with a thick coating of fur, which makes them
resistant to the cold, but vulnerable to fire.  Their fear of drowning is
well known, and they avoid entering any water unless they are absolutely
forced to.  
 
~
-1 DUERGAR GREY-DWARF GREYDWARF~
Grey Dwarves, more commonly known as Duergar, are a subterranean race
whose murderous exploits have brought them to the surface to pillage.  Like
all Dwarves, they have a natural resistance to poison, disease, infravision,
and an unreasoning fear of water.  Years spent dabbling in the dark arts
have also given them a strong resistance to magic.  Duergar are adept
thieves, their high dexterity a compliment to their cunning minds and sharp
intellect.  Hatred for all that is good and a desire to cause destruction
mark them as a truly evil race 
 
~
-1 DARK-ELF DARKELF DARKELVES DROW~
Dark-Elves, more commonly known as Drow, are renegade surface elves who
have fled into the dark caverns beneath the earth to escape the restrictive
confines of ordered society.  They retain similiar strengths to their fair
cousins, with high intellect and great dexterity, and are also light of
build.  They bear yet the natural elven resistance to charm spells,
infravision, and the ability to move swiftly and silently without being
noticed.  But their hearts, like their skin, are as black as night, and a
drow elf will go out of his way to cause pain and suffering to another.  
 
~
-1 SATYR SATYRS~
Satyr are a half-human, half-goat race of pleasure loving creatures. 
Known for their wild and carefree spirit, they greatly love chasing women
and strong drink.  They have roughly the same strengths as a human, but much
greater dexterity.  Living in the forest for many years has given them a
resistance to disease, and they will find that wooden weapons have
difficulty piercing their tough hides.  Keen eyesight, combined with natural
infravision, places them among the first to become aware of trouble.  
 
~
-1 GITHYANKI GITHYANKIS~
Githyanki are an extraplanar race of evil humanoids.  Their skin is
leathery and yellow, sharp fangs are revealed when they laugh.  They are
endowed with a natural ability to see in the darkness and have no
vulnerabilities.  Githyanki excel in most any profession they chose and are
a well rounded race.  
 
~
-1 ROCKSEER ROCKSEERS~
Rockseer, like the Drow, have abandoned life above ground to live beneath
the surface.  Rockseer, unlike the Drow, are not inherently evil, the world
of politics, government and society does not concern them and they remain
neutral in all matters.  They spend their entire lives dedicated to tending
rock gardens deep in the caverns of the Underdark, though a few have been
known to journey to the surface.  Years spent working with rocks have given
Rockseer a unique ability to walk through stones and to meld into them. 
Combined with their naturally high dexterity, a Rockseer's ability to meld
into stone gives them an excellant armor class rating.  Due to the unique
nature of their flesh, Rockseer shun the use of wooden weapons or equipment
as it causes them pain.  Rockseer, like all true elves, bear a resistance to
charm, have infravision, and are able to move silently without being seen.  
 
~
-1 TROLL TROLLS~
Long hidden within the sanctity of their mountain caves, a race known in
the past only as myth, lies the civilization of the trolls.  Built with the
undying stamina which any mountaindweller seems to have, these green skinned
beasts often grow to obtain a state of health few other races believed
possible.  Hindered by their slow intellect and mobility, the troll society
seems to have decided as a whole to rejoin the races of the realms, moving
out of their sanctuaries in numbers reaching high into the thousands

-1 RANGER RANGERS~
Outdoorsmen, hunters, masters of woodcraft, rangers are the guardians of
the forest.  In addition to having exellant fighting skills, they are
wielders of some powerful magic.  Some rangers have been known to call large
bears to their aid, fashion mystical staves, and have the ability to
camouflage themselves beyond detection.  Their ability to ambush their
opponents makes them a deadly foe.  
 
~
-1 NINJA NINJAS~
Masters of the art of weaponless combat, these mysterious warriors have
recently become more common in the land.  A ninja prides himself in his
ability to strike quickly and silently before fading into the shadows,
learning the art of assassination through rigorous training.  Ninja believe
that it is a loss of honor to touch blades with their opponent, and will
never parry a blow.  In addition to a diverse repertoire of fighting
abilities, ninja have use of a strange magic, spells that no wizard today is
capable of duplicating.  
 
~
-1 'ANTI-PALADINS ANTIPALADINS'~
The unholy counterpart to a paladin, these chaotic knights have chosen
evil as their course.  Combining superb fighting skills with a large
reportoire of necromantic spells makes an anti-paladin a deadly opponent. 
Anti-paladins are utterly ruthless and delight in the terror and suffering
that their presence brings.  
~
-1 PALADIN PALADINS~
These warriors have chosen the path of virtue and chivalry above all
others.  This dedication to their cause grants them priest-like spells and
healing powers.  They are also formidable fighters, always questing to stamp
out evil.  Paladins must stay good in order to cast their spells.  Those who
forsake goodness are strongly frowned upon.  Paladins are the epitome of all
that is good and true, and they will gladly sacrifice their lives for their
beliefs.  
 
~
-1 CLERIC CLERICS~
Clerics are the most defensively oriented of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat 
spells being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the 
best class by far at healing magics, and they possess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

~
-1 THIEF THIEVES~
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

~
-1 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

~
-1 WARLOCK WARLOCKS~
Male Magicians...Stronger, but less efective on charm..

~
-1 'SAMURAI'~
The mighty samurai warriors have travelled to these realms from a distant
continent.  A samurai swears absolute loyalty to his Lord, acting as a
retainer and enforcer.  Honor, above all else, is their credo.  A true
samurai will not flee from combat as it brings dishonor to them.  A samurai
does not take defeat lightly, and may take his own life if he fails in
battle too many times.  
 
Note: Samurai are a highly advanced class to play.  If you are a beginner, it
is strongly recommended that you choose a different class to play.  Samurai
become very powerful at the higher levels, however, if they die 11 times, they
will automatically DELETE themselves.  In addition, once a samurai has passed
level 10 he will no longer flee from fights unless the character he is fighting
is much stronger than him, in which case he can use the dishonor command to
escape the fight.

~
-1 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
These undead beings are ancient warriors, well versed in the use of
necromantic magic.  A vampire during the day will pass for an ordinary human
being, but by night will often revert to their true undead form.  As a
vampire transforms, his body increases in size, gains additional strength,
renders him immune to negative energies, and allows him to gain sustenance
from the lifeblood of his victims.  A vampire's flesh burns under the touch
of natural, and some magical light, causing them great pain.  They can never
escape their true identify fully, and although players cannot recognize them
in their unchanged state, creatures know them to be lifeless undead and will
not attack them.

recall to and is where the pit is to which your corpse will decay. 
Everyone starts at mud school, which is connected to each of the hometowns.

~
-1 ETHOS~
You may pick a Lawful, Neutral or Chaotic ethos.  This shows your opinion
toward the laws of the land (not the rules).  If you plan on obeying the
laws no matter what, you take a lawful ethos, if you will obey the laws
some of the time, then you are neutral.  If you plan on breaking the laws
and only obeying them when you just happen to obey the laws, then you are
chaotic.  Ethos can only be set once.

sidestep later, the samurai places himself in front of a different opponent.

~
-1 'SECOND WEAPON'~

skill, as it requires great discipline in practicing and using.  If you are

See also: ROLEPLAYING GROUP ALIGNMENT
 
~
0 ALIGNMENT~
In the interest of attracting the right caliber of followers, the
immortals of Muddy have outlined the following alignments.  See where
you think you fit in.

Lawful Good:   An orderly, strong society with a well-organized government
	       can make life better for the majority of the people.  To ensure
	       the quality of life, laws must be created and obeyed.  When
	       people respect the laws, and try to help each other, society as
	       whole prospers. 

Lawful Neutral:  Also believes in a strong, well-organized government, whether
	       it is a tyranny or democracy.  Organization and regimentation
	       bring benefits that outweigh any moral questions raised by
	       their actions.

Lawful Evil:   The use of society and its laws for personal benefit.  Structure
	       and organization elevate those who deserve to rule as well as
	       provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant.
	       Laws and societies are supported so long as they fit with
	       personal concerns.  Laws are obeyed out of fear of punishment.

Neutral Good:  A balance of forces is important, but the concerns of laws and
	       chaos do not moderate the need for good.  The universe is vast
	       and contains many creatures striving for different goals, so a
	       pursuit of good will not upset the balance.  Fostering good may
	       mean supporting an organized society, or overthrowing the
	       existing social order.  Social structure has no innate value.         
  
True Neutral:  Almost impossible to find such people as the majority of people
	       make judgments.  It is their duty to see that all of the forces
	       (evil, good, law, and chaos) remain in balance.  Alliances with
	       such people are odd, as they tend to switch sides as one side
	       brings the other to the point of destruction.

Neutral Evil:  The primary concern for such people is their own advancement.
	       Working with others or on their own, their only interest is 
	       getting ahead.  Such people are known for their 'Me, Myself,
	       and I' personalities.  No scruples, no conscience.

Chaotic Good:  Strong individualists marked with a streak of kindness and 
	       benevolence.  Goodness and right matter, but there is little
	       use for laws and regulations.  Their actions are morally good
	       but may not be in perfect agreement with the rest of society.
					  
Chaotic Neutral:  There is no order to anything, even their own actions.
	       Good and Evil are irrelevant when making a decision.  They
	       are almost totally unreliable, except for the fact that you
	       can rely on them being like this.  The true coin-flipper, they
	       rely on fate and chance to lead them.

Chaotic Evil:  The bane of all that is good and organized.  Laws and
	       governments are the tools of weaklings unable to fend for
	       themselves.  The strong have a right to what they want, and
	       weak are there to be exploited.  Leadership among CEs is based
	       on power, with the leader capable of bullying his underlings
	       into obedience.  

Each god may accept a follower based on these outlines.
~
0 FOLLOW GROUP NOFOLLOW NOFOL~
Syntax: follow <character>
	group
	group <character>
	nofol 

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within 8 levels of
your own. Groups of 2 and 3 get experience bonuses.  See "help experience".

NOFOL is a toggle which makes you no longer accept followers.  This also
causes all people and mobs from following you at that time including who
you are following.  Type NOFOL again to reset the toggle back to accepting
followers.  No one can follow you when this toggle is set.

~
-1 RULES~
These are the rules for the Realms of Icey Depths.  You are expected to
read them and memorize them.  Ignorance of the rules is no excuse.
 
1. Do not ask Immortals for equipment or spells.  They are not allowed to
help you in this manner as it would be cheating.

2. If you are asked by an Immortal, whether they are invisible or plainly
visible, do not ignore them, respond to their request immediately without
questioning them "who they are".  This question is considered rude, and will
 
3. You are welcome to multiplay with up to two (2) characters.  Do not long on
more than two characters at once for any reason.
 
4. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER I repeat, NEVER multiplay a pkill.  You are allowed
to group with another player and group pkill.  You are NOT allowed to use two
of your own characters to kill someone else, punishment for multiplaying a
pkill is severe.  You have been warned.
 
5. Do not exploit bugs or loopholes.  If you are caught exploiting them, and
you will be caught eventually, you will be punished.  If you discover bugs or
loopholes, report them to Erebus, and he will award you 25 qps.  You've got
everything to lose by abusing errors in the game, and everything to gain by
reporting them.
 
6. Don't cheat.  If you're caught, you will be punished.  Nuff said.

7. Dont's spam people on purpose; that means filling up their screen with
useless information by repeatedly entering the same command.  This is very rude
and is considered bad form on all accounts.
 
 
8. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated.  If your "partner" has not
consented then leave them alone.
 
                       +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+
 
The staff at Icey is working very hard to make playing here enjoyable for
everyone.  The rules that you see here are imposed on EVERYONE to create
a fair playing environment for all players.
~
1 'LAW' 'LAWS'~
The laws of the land that shall be enforced by the Ruler Clan are as
follows :
 
The areas that are defined as protected by the jurisdiction of the Law are
the entirety of Midgaard, New Thalos, Valley of Titans, Ofcol, and Gerighelm.

1. No Player Killing/Stealing/Looting in any protected area.  Theft is fully
   illegal.  This includes the attempt of stealing any from a person OR looting
   a player's corpse OR looting the pit when a player's equipment has returned
   from their decayed corpse.  Stealing also includes taking a disarmed weapon
   or equipment during a legal duel that is not your own.  Looting a criminal's
   corpse is unlawful within the towns.  You will be held responsible for your
   groupmate's actions.
 
2. No offensive area spells or harmful powers will be used in any protected
   area.  This includes area spells from charmed, summoned or attacked mobs.
   Aggressive mobs may not be summoned/brought into any protected area.
								       
3. Aiding known criminals in any way by directly giving them equipment,
   helping them to elude punishment, to kill Ruler guards, etc.
   will result in a WANTED flag.
								       
4. Intrusion into the Ruler Clan is considered illegal and an attack upon
   the laws themselves.  

5. A dispersal that teleports the victim from a protected area directly into
   the room of an aggressive mob that causes their death is considered a
   player kill and will result in a WANTED flag on the caster.

6. Garbling Ruler members is against the law.  This prevents them from
   doing their job and is considered an offensive attack upon the law itself.

~
1 WANTED ~
Syntax: WANTED <player> <Y or N>

This is a clan skill for the Legions of Ruler that flags or unflags
a player as a criminal. Many good mobs do not take kindly to criminals.
Only members of the Ruler clan can flag or unflag criminals.
~
-1 'BLACKJACK'~
Syntax: blackjack <target>

Using a small leather sack filled with sand or lead, the thief delivers a
blow to the back of the victim's head, rendering them unconscious.  But as
one astute adventurer remarked: 
"It is not a killing stroke.  Thieves know what happened to thieves who killed
people.  The ninja's guild came and talked briefly to them--in fact, all they
said was 'Good-bye'". -t.p.
~
0 REQUEST ~
Syntax: request <object> <mobile>

Good characters may use this command to request items in the inventory or
equipment of a good aligned mob.  See consider for more info.
Consider the player's level when making a request for another player.  The
limits were put on request for a reason.  An unproven player does not deserve
Diana's armor.  You are merely removing the mob's ability to defend itself
against evil doers.  There is a 3 minute (real time) wait for requesting.
~
-1 'STRANGLE'~
Syntax: strangle <victim>

~
0 PHILOSOPHY ~
Here is a general philosophy of each of the known clans.

Ruler:  The enforcement of the laws above all.  The world exists in two
	halves: right and wrong.  The law comes first in all respects.
	They control and decide what is lawful or not.  Their word is law.

BattleRager:  BattleRagers live for combat, and look down on those who need    
	      magic to survive.  They have a strong aversion to mage magic,
	      and are very wary of clerical magic.

Chaos:    Chaos wants to spread chaos throughout the land.  Not necessarily
	  evil, just against the orderwed society.  They feel that laws and
	  rules hamper freedom, and will go out of their way to see them
	  broken, or to cause chaos.

Knight:   Honor is valued above all else.  These fighting warriors seek to
	  right injustices and correct wrongs.  They follow the ideals of
	  the paladin. 

Shalafi:  In Dark-Elf language, it means 'Master'. Discipline brings power.
          This is the motto of the Masters of Arcane Arts. The advancement 
          of the Art is their motivation.  They look down on physical combat, 
          preferring to use their magic.

 
Invader:  Invader is born to invade or massacre.  Establishment of its power
     over all is its goal.  Invader, in short, wants to control the
     whole world, but would never do so openly.

~
0 RESETS~
Syntax: RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> <location on body>    - equips last mobile
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> inside <obj vnum>     - store in container
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
        RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<max #>]             - load a mobile
        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

{c               +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+{x

SHALAFI was founded hundreds of years ago by an elite group of Drow
wizards, known as "The Circle of Three".  In the Drow tongue, SHALAFI means
'Master', a title which all Dark Elves aspire to receive.  Indeed they are
the Master of the Arcane, continously refining casting techniques of old,
perfecting new ways of focusing their spells, and seeking out other, more
powerful forms of magic.

Their lust for power is unrivalled, and were it possible, they would
overthrow the gods themselves.  Every waking moment is spent hiding in the
shadows, devising new schemes to gain them power through chicanery and
subterfuge.  Those who would join this clan must have no qualms about
murder, for it is the order of the day if you are an INVADER.

and try to kill YOU.  There is a timer on this command so that you can't
just walk around and collect free gear from mobs.
