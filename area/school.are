Tzbrakas~
The mighty storm giant, Tzbrakas, welcomes you to his academy.

Before you stands one of the largest giants that you have ever seen.
Despite the scars covering his war-torn body, his features are soft, and his
smile warm.  He beckons to you and bids you enter his training grounds that
you might learn to fend for yourself in this strange new world.

troll ravenous~
a ravenous troll~
A grossly fat troll is seated at an oaken table, feasting on a roasted chicken.
~
The troll is covered in a full suit of platemail that looks heavy and
impenetrable.  His face is covered in grease and pieces of chicken.  He is
too intent on devouring this chicken to even notice that you are walking up
to him with a naked weapon.  You're pretty sure that if you can't kill him
you'd be able to outrun him since he's so fat and will be slowed down by his
heavy armor.

flee~
Fleeing will cost you 10 experience points every time that you flee.  Be
careful what you chose to attack, though, because many mobs have a good
memory of who attacked them and will track you down to kill you.  Also take
note, that combat will start your adrenaline pumping, and while your
adrenaline is pumping, you will be unable to focus your thoughts enough to
pray for {RRECALL{x.  You can set your character to automatically flee when
it gets hurt too badly with the {RWIMPY{x command.  
 
Try this now:
          {RWIMPY{x
 
Attack the troll now, but use the {RFLEE{x command after you attack him
   because he is too strong for you:
          {RFLEE{x (after you have attacked him)
~
E
consider~
Before you attack anything, you should always use the {RCONSIDER{x
command first.  "Consider" will give you a rough idea of how strong your
intended victim is compared to you.  Some mobs are stronger than they
appear, so don't always assume that you can kill something because
"consider" tells you it will be easy.  This is especially true for
magic-using mobs, since they are capable of casting spells that will do
large amounts of damage to you in a single hit.  {BALWAYS{x check for escape
routes before you attack and plan your battles carefully.  
 
Try it now:
          {RCONSIDER TROLL{x

@eng Remember, don't fight the blob to the finish!  Just type 'KILL BLOB', then

@eng You are in the Arena.  Remember, if you wish to get out of this Arena, just
go up.  Ceilings can barely be seen in this huge Arena.  You feel as if you are
being watched by some divine being.
@rus Ты на арене. Помни, что если ты захочешь отсюда выйти, просто пойди на
верх (up). Потолок гигантской арены едва различим в высоте. Ты чувствуешь себя
так, как будто за тобой наблюдает божественное существо.

A Guest Room~
You are standing in a private guest room.  The room is richly furnished
and decorated.  The beige carpet underfoot is made of pure wool, and is very
comfortable to walk on in bare feet.  Soft pastel blue wallpaper covers the
walls to the ceiling.  Antique oil paintings hang at various locations on
the walls.  A blue marble basin filled with fresh water sits on top of the
dresser.

Large grey, white, and black flagstones pave the entire courtyard.  You
feel like you are standing in a giant pit as you survey the cut stone walls
rising some 120 feet overhead to meet the clear sky.  The last 15 feet form
a walled enclosure at the ground level to prevent people from falling into
the courtyard below.  The courtyard entrance lies directly to the south of

The Hall of Learning~
You are standing in the hallway of learning.  Here you can learn the
basic information and commands that you will need in your travels.  There is
a lush red carpet underfoot, the room is brightly lit and the air smells
pleasantly fresh.  In the center of the hallway there are a number of
{W*black marble tablets*{x with writing etched onto them.  

To read the tablets in this room:

scan~
Scan is a default command which everyone receives at level 1, not a skill
that you must practice.  Scanning will allow you to not only see the
available exits, but also to see which mobiles/players are in the rooms next
to you, and to see any exits with closed doors in front of them.  If you
scan in one direction, you will be able to see more than one room in that
direction provided that there is nothing blocking your view, such as a door
or blank wall.  On the same note, you can look in any of the available
directions to view the extended exit description for that direction, if
there is one.  
 
   Syntax:
             {RSCAN{x
          {RSCAN NORTH, SCAN SOUTH etc.{x
             {RLOOK{x

autoexits~
You can decide whether or not you wish the room exits to appear below the
room description or not.  Use the "autoexits" toggle to turn them on or off.

 
   Syntax:
          {RAUTOEXIT{x
~
E
movement~
There are 6 possible directions for you to move in; {BNorth, South, East,
West, Up, Down{x.  You will not always be able to move in all 6 directions
in every room, though.  To move from one room to the next, simply type in
the direction you wish to move, you can abbreviate the direction by entering
only the first letter of the direction, as follows:
 
          {RN or NORTH{X
          {RS or SOUTH{X
          {RE or EAST{X
          {RW or WEST{X
          {RU or UP{X
          {RD or DOWN{x
 
Try moving in each direction from this room, then type the opposite
direction to return and finish reading the other tablets.

containers~
Containers are useful for storing large quantities of items, since your
inventory is only able to hold a few items.  The two main types of portable
containers are packs and drink containers.  A pack can hold any type of
object, provided that the object isn't too big and your pack isn't too full.
A drink container is much smaller than a pack and will usually fit inside it
quite easily.  A drink container will only hold drinkable liquids.  
~
E
inventory~
Every player has an inventory whether they are alive, dead, asleep, or
wide awake.  Your inventory is a list of the items which you have readily
available at your disposal.  The number of items that you can carry is
directly related to your current dexterity.  Items held inside containers
don't count towards the total number of items that you can carry in your
inventory.  You can check "Items Carried" in your score, these are the
current vs max number of items your inventory can hold.

take you to different location every time.  Some portals, like the one you

To wield any weapons that you have use the {RWIELD{x command.

It is a good idea to wield only those weapons with which you are
proficient, or you will do very little damage to your foes in battle. 
Choose a weapon from the weapons rack and try wielding it.  If you see:
{B"You don't even know which end is up..."  {x for the weapon you just
wielded, remove, drop that one, and select a different one from the rack.  
{R*{BREMEMBER{R*{x If the sword doesn't feel right in your hand, chose a DIFFERENT weapon from the rack and try that one instead.

equipment~
A good suit of equipment is important to any adventurer.  To check your
current equipment, use the {REQUIPMENT{x command.  You must be in the awake
position and not be blinded to see your list of equipment.  During battles
your equipment will become damaged, so you should try to have it repaired
once every so often.
Try it now:
          {REQ{x
 
You will notice that your buckler is already damaged.  The dwarven
blacksmith standing here can repair it for you.  First make sure that it is
in your inventory, then enter:
          {RESTIMATE BUCKLER{x
 
This will show you how much he will charge you to repair it.  Now that you
have your estimate have him repair it for you:
          {RREPAIR SHIELD{x
 
Once you have passed level 5 you will not be able to enter the newbie
academy anymore, so you will have to go elsewhere to have armor and
weapons repaired.  The weaponsmith and armorer in Midgaard can also
repair armor and weapons for you.

stats~
Your stats are displayed in the bar of information running across your
screen and updated every time you hit the return key.  Your main stats are
hitpoints, mana, and moves.  Your hitpoints decrease when you take damage
from battle, from spells affecting you, or from hunger and thirst.  When
your hitpoints reach -1 you will become unconscious and will slowly die if
not aided by the time they reach -10.  Your mana is used when you cast all
spells and with the use of certain skills.  Moves are used by travelling
from one room to another, different amounts of movement are used depending
on the type of terrain you are crossing.  All of your main stats will heal
themselves as you regenerate.  
~
E
sleep~
You will lose hitpoints, mana and moves as you travel and engage in
combat with others.  This is a temporary loss, however, and they will slowly
increase as you regenerate.  You can speed up the process by resting or
sleeping.  Sleeping will cause you to heal much more quickly than resting,
but resting will allow you to see what is taking place in the room at the
same time.  If you can find a piece of furniture, a chair, a bed or
something to sleep on, you will heal even more quickly.  If you are hungry,
thirsty, poisoned, or plagued you will regenerate much more slowly, and may
lose your strength faster than you regain it.

prompt~
Everyone has a prompt.  Your prompt is the bar of information that runs
across your screen every time you hit the return key.  It is a good idea to
carefully select the information to display in your prompt so that you can
keep it as short as possible and make it easy to read during battle.  You
should always include your current hitpoints in your prompt.  You can also
include color in your prompt, but color will shorten the number of things

The Hallway of Learning~
You are standing in the hallway of learning.  Here you can learn the
basic information and commands that you will need in your travels.  There is
a lush red carpet underfoot, the room is brightly lit and the air smells
pleasantly fresh.  In the center of the hallway there are a number of
{W*black marble tablets*{x with writing on them.  
 
To read the tablets in this room:
 
          {RLOOK COMBAT{X
             {RLOOK DEATH{X
          {RLOOK MURDER{x
 
When you have finished reading these tablets, go east for your first battle.

murder~
Playerkilling, or {RPK{x ,as it's often called, is an important part of
the mud.  Whether you chose to engage in playerkilling yourself is entirely
up to you.  However, you will be able to PK, or be PK'd when you reach level
10.  To begin a PK fight, you can use the {RMURDER{x command, or you can use
any attack spells or skills that you possess to begin the fight.  Keep in
mind, PK here only to add to the realism of the mud, so if you are going to
PK, there had better be a good reason for it.  Every PK fight should be
roleplayed.  If you are a lawful good paladin, you are not going to be seen
sneaking around murdering everyone.  
 
For further information, read:

E
death~
When your hitpoints drop down too far, you will die.  When you die you
will lose 2/3's of the experience that you had gained towards the next
level.  In addition, every three deaths will result in the loss of 1
constitution point, although you may train this back again.  Dying is a part
of mudding.  So if you die, take it in stride, and learn from your mistakes
in the battle that caused your death.  

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

When you die, all of your equipment is still on your corpse in the same room
you died in.  To get it back, you must retrace your steps to the place
that you were killed.  Make sure to grab a lightsource before you leave town,
though, since you will probably have to travel through dark places to get
back to the place that you died.
~
E
combat~
To begin a battle use either the {RKILL{x command or if you have spells,
can cast an attack spell on your target to begin the fight.  Some mobs will
initiate the fight themselves, though, aggressively attacking you as soon as
you approach them.  You won't encounter many of these as a newbie, but as
you increase in levels and begin to explore the higher level areas, you will
find more aggressive mobs.  During combat there are certain spells and
skills that you will be able to use, and others that you won't, you will
have to experiment to see which do and which don't, so keep your eyes open,
and try them all.

The End of the Hallway of Learning~
You have reached the end of the hallway of learning.  By now you should
have mastered the basic commands and have a passable understanding of how to
manage your character.  If you are still not sure what to do, use the newbie
channel to ask politely for help, otherwise, proceed down to the Academy
Proper.

  {R*{BREMEMBER{R*{x , keep your eyes open, and explore everything, you never know what you'll find if you look carefully.

The Sparring Courtyard~
Large grey, white, and black flagstones pave the entire courtyard.  You
feel like you are standing in a giant pit as you survey the cut stone walls
rising some 120 feet overhead to meet the clear sky.  The last 15 feet form
a walled enclosure at the ground level to prevent people from falling into
the courtyard below.
