Welcome to Westland. This is one of the two lands that are in
this world. There is a great wizard named Darken Rahl who
wishes to rule the two lands. D'Hara is the more powerful of the
two lands. One reasons is, that several million years ago, the
greatest wizards of all had created two lands. The Westlands was
the only land that had no magic what-so-ever. He also divided the
two lands with a magical Boundry. This boundry was created to
stop all magic from  going into the other land.

D'Hara.  This is Darken Rahl's home land and he is most powerful
here. Even though he is powerful you might still be able to
defeat him. Beware of the Azrith Plains for they are huge and go
from north to west to east and to south. It is very easy to get
lost in the Plains so try to find the way to Darken Rahl and the
People's Palace before it is too late or you get lost! You really
must hurry for Darken Rahl has almost won the battle and will
control the lands!

Path By a Lake.~
You are walking beside a beautiful lake that is crystal
clear. There is a fresh breeze in the air and the trees are
rocking freely. You feel as though you are entering a new world
but you're still in Icey.  The lake to your right is crystal
clear and calm. There are a family of ducks floating by seeming
not to notice you. The woods around you are flled with deer,
birds, and other animals. The trees are tall and lush, leaving
not much room for the sun to enter into these sacred lands. The
path continues to the north and, of course, where you came from,
the south.

A Clearing in the Woods.~
As you come out of the forest you enter a clearing in the
woods. This clearing isn't very big but it sure is good to see
the sun again. There are two large signs nailed on a tree leading
back into another forest. You wonder what the sign says and go to
take a closer look. There are two exits here by the lake. One
goes south to the path and the other goes north into the woods
again.

Welcome! Here you are in the middle of a forest beside Trout

As you walk down the road you come across a path leading up into the
mountains.  Since going north will lead right into the lake you must go west
up into the mountains.  There is a little rabbit drinking from a small pond
infront of you.  You wonder where such a beautiful creature came from.  You
could still go back south to the turn in the road.

As you approach the mountains, you leave the forest behind to open air
space.  The wind here is blowing more swiftly and the sun is even hotter. 
You notice the giant wayward pines that loom overhead.  You wonder where
such wonderous trees came from.  The path up the mountain looks like a nice
and easy one to take.  You could retrun to the east or go up the mountain.

come to the top of the trail you realize that you are now in Upper Ven. 
Upper Ven is the mountain before the city.  The path look quite clear and
easy to pass.  The rocks are warm in the sun's rays and are gleaming with a
mirage from the heat.  You may go north or down.

You reach the end of the mountain and have to go down again.  The path
leads back into another forest and seems appealing to you to get out of the
sun.  The forest is filled with trees and shrubs all are changing color,
heralding the approaching cold of the winter season.  The gold and bronze
colors of the leaves are quite beautiful and look as if they are each worth
more than life itself.  The mountain air is fresh and cool, and it makes you
feel like sitting down to take a rest.  You may go down or south.

The Trail in the Forest.~
You have entered the forest near the town of Hartland.  The path is
outlined with bright yellow flowers and little purple plants.  There is a
little shack far off to the north east that, for some reason, doesn't look
very welcoming.  The forest isn't very thick and you can see all around you.
There are wild ferns and other plants that you have never seen before. 
There is one plant that you've never seen before, but think that you
recognize it from a book that you read.  This forest is a sanctuary from the
heat of the sun.  A trail leads north to the outskirts of Hartland and back
up into the mountains.

You are standing at the outskirts of the little town, Hartland.  The road
you walk on is dry and dust covered.  Its seems like it hasn't rained for
quite sometime.  Up ahead you can see the town beginning to take shape. 
Many people have gathered together out in the streets, crowding around a
tall, white-robed man.  The town is full of life, and the people look happy
with their lot in life.

The Town of Hartland.~
You have entered the town of Hartland.  Everyone here and joyful.  The
are listening to a speech about fire, which doesn't interest you overly,
thought the speaker is rather dynamic.  You are surprised at the powerful
influence this man has over his audience, and they listen, enraptured, to
his every word.  There are a number of plain houses on either side of you,
but they don't look particularly interesting to you.  You can go north
through a path in the fields, or south back to the woods.

The Fields of Hartland.~
You have entered the fields outside of the town and are on your way to
South Haven.  Near South Haven is where the Narrows are.  In order to get to
South Haven you must cross the swamps on the way.  The air is surprisingly
still and peaceful.  There are few trees around and even fewer animals.  The
trail leads north into a swamp, whose foul stench steals your breath away,
the path south leads back to the town of Hartland.  North back to the town
you came from.

As you walk along the trail the forest begins to get thicker and thicker.
The trail becomes more and more hidden and a mist hangs thickly in the air. 
The trees are bunched closely together and the sun is no longer visible. 
The air is very musty and is beginning to get colder.  In the distance you
hear the baying of the heart hounds as they join the hunt.

You have arrived at the swamp at the same time as the heart hounds.  The
heart hound will not enter the swamp so it must be your only choice...  Or
fight.  The swamp looks uninviting and you don't know what sort of creatures
live under the murky waters.  There is a small island in the center of the
swamp that seems deserted.  The waters in the swamp are shallow enough to
pass by foot.  You had better decide quickly, fight the hounds, or wade to
the island.  The exits are back east or west.

As you are crossing the waters you notice that the hounds don't follow

can't wait to get there.  You notice the water starts to move and then you
see them.  Snakes.  Little yellow deadly snakes.  All over the place.  You
start to run as fast as you can towards the island.  You could go east to
the island or back west.

As you climb up on on the island you realize that the snakes don't follow
you on to dry land.  The hounds are still back on the other shore and will
not enter the waters.  The hounds let out yelps of frustration.  The island
doesn't have any trees or plants.  Looking to the east you see the new path
to SouthHaven.  You wonder when you should attempt to cross the waters
again.  The exits are to the east, and to the west.

hounds have returned back to their home, in the boundary.  The swamp gets
shallower as you approach the land again and the sky goes clear.  The exits
are east the shore or back west to the island.

south towards SouthHaven and you can hear the faint sounds of the
city life. You continue your hike to SouthHaven. You may go back
to the swamps to the west or continue east.

are plants growing in the woods.  The trip to South Haven isn't as bad as
you thought.  You can see the village up ahead.  The exits are west to the

As you approach this village the giant gates open up to welcome you.  The
city is alive with action in the streets.  There are children everywhere and
people at the stores.  The village road continues on to the east where you
notice a pub.  Perhaps you'll stop in and have a cup of ale.  The road leads

hear some people talking about their weekends and what they want
to do. There is a fresh cool breeze floating through the city.
The exits are north to the gates, east to the bar, or south to

will need to cross into D'Hara. The path is wide and quite
visable. There are little animals running around in the woods all
about. You notice that the trees are thicker and a lot greener.
The humidity begins to rise and it starts to feel hotter. Your
legs start to get tired when you see the Bone Woman's shack up
ahead. It would be good to visit her. Her shack is about oh..
twenty or so yards ahead and will take no time to reach it. You
spot the Narrows up ahead. The exits are north to the village or
south to the Bone Woman.

The Path to the Bone Woman's Shack.~
You walk out into a clearing in the woods and notice that
the sky is starting to become over cast again. The woods look
ready for rain and the trees have their leaves turned upwards.
There is a shack to the west of you which must belong to the Bone
Woman. The shack looks nice and cosy. It would be nice to stay and have
a visit with the old Bone Woman. The exits are north to the
forest, west to the bone Woman, and south to the Narrows.

The Bone Woman's Shack.~
You enter a room that has bones all over the walls. There is
a nice warm fireplace sitting in the corner giving off heat and
light. A oil lamp is hanging from a beam in the roof and gives
the room an eerie glow. There are bones in little piles on the
floors and an old lady stands in the center of the room. She has
a big smile on her face and offerse you to stay in her home for
as long as you wish. The exit is back to the east, out on the
trail.

The Narrows.~
You have reached the Narrows. This is a very dangerous place
to be in. There are many underworld beasts that live in the
narrows. You should stay on guard and not fall asleep. The exits
are west to continue into the narrows, or north to return to the
bone woman for a cup of tea.

The Path Through The Narrows.~
The trail you are following is an easy on to follow. There
is no sound which frightens you a little but then the fear
passes. As you continue west you can see the center of the
narrows approaching. Apparently they are the most dangerous part
of the whole narrows. The exits are west to the center or east to
the entrance of the narrows.

The Center of the Narrows.~
You approach the center of the Narrows when you spot it. A
shadow person. They have a poisonous touch and are the
undertakers of the dead. You try to get past it without making
him attack. The sky is getting dark and you still have a little
ways to go. The exits are in an east-west direction, west being
the way you want to go.

Near The End of the Narrows.~
You are approaching the end of the narrows. You give a sigh
of relief that you are almost out of this dreaded place. The sun
is setting out ahead of you making it hard to see your way. The
air starts to cool down as the sun sets in the west. You try to
hurry your way out of the narrows before dark. The exits are of
course; east and west.

The Azrith Plains.~
Welcome to D'Hara! You have successfully passed through the
narrows and are standing infront of the Azrith Plains. The plains
are quite massive and reach as far as your eyes can see. In the
distance, you see the home of Darken Rahl, the Peoples Palace.
You have to cross the Azrith Plains in order to get to Darken
Rahl in his massive palace.
The exits are north and east.

The Path Through the Plains.~
You have found a path that is quite long but leads to Darken
Rahl's Palace. The path is covered with stones and there is an
occassional tree here and there. The sky is bright and clear and
it is a hot day. You start to be thirsty and you feel sort of
tired. Your only choice is to go ahead onto the Peoples Palace
and stop Darken Ralh then steel a drink and a bite to eat. The
way back through the Narrows doesn't seem appealing. The exits
are north and south.

trail. Maybe she will listen to you and move out of the way.
Maybe she will eat you up for breakfast... Hmmmmmm...Breakfast
sure would be nice. The exits are north and south.

so you wont have to fight it on the way back...Maye you should
just turn around and go back to mommy for some cookies...mmmm

Rahl. The exits are North and South ass usual.

with these people. You decide not to stop and keep on going. The
exits are to the north, south and to the east there is a room

The Garden of Life.~
This is a cavernous room filled with wonders sorts of
magical plants. Leaded windows high overhead let in the light for
the lush plants. Around the outside of the room are flowers set
in beds, with walkways winding through. Beyond the flowers are
small trees, short stone walls with vines covering them, and
well-tended plants completing the landscaping. Except for the
windows overhead, this room mimics an outdoor garden. In the
centre of this expansive room is an area of lawn that sweeps
around almost into a circle, the grass ring broken by a wedge of
white stone, upon which sits a slab of granite, smooth but for
grooves carved near the edge of the top, leading to a small well
in one corner. It is held up by two short fluted pedestals.
Beyond the slab stands a polished stone block set next to a fire
pit.  In the centre of the lawn lies a round area of white
sorcerer's sand, ringed with torches that burn with fluid flames.

The only exit is south.
